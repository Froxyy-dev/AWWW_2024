## Description


If you’ve ever seen a flowchart or flow diagram, then you’ve seen a decision tree in action. As the name suggests, decision trees are used to make decisions based on the data that has been provided. Each branching point in the diagram represents an algorithm that will be executed on the input data. This process is repeated for each branch until a final decision is reached at the end of the tree.
