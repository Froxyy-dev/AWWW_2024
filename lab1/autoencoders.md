## Description


Another unsupervised algorithm, autoencoders, are neural networks that are used for dimension reduction. They take an input, encode it in a lower-dimensional space that preserves the most important information, and then decode the data into its original form. The end result is a compressed version of the original data that can be used for analysis and comparison.

### Wikipedia description


An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data (unsupervised learning). An autoencoder learns two functions: an encoding function that transforms the input data, and a decoding function that recreates the input data from the encoded representation. The autoencoder learns an efficient representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction.
