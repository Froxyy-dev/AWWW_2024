## Description


Support vector machines, or SVMs for short, are used for regression and classification problems. They work by using past examples to build a model that can be used to classify new data points. SVMs are one of the most powerful classification algorithms available, and they have been shown to outperform other popular classification algorithms in many different situations.

### Wikipedia description


In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised max-margin models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most studied models, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974).
