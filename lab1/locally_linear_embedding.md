## Description


Locally linear embedding, or LLE for short, is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that uses low-dimensional manifolds to map high-dimensional data points. It finds similar data points and maps them to nearby locations on the manifold. This allows it to preserve local distances within the dataset while preserving global distances between different data clusters.

### Wikipedia description


Nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also known as manifold learning, refers to various related techniques that aim to project high-dimensional data onto lower-dimensional latent manifolds, with the goal of either visualizing the data in the low-dimensional space, or learning the mapping (either from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional embedding or vice versa) itself. The techniques described below can be understood as generalizations of linear decomposition methods used for dimensionality reduction, such as singular value decomposition and principal component analysis.
