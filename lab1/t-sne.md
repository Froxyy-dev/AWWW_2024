# t-SNE

## Description


In addition to LLE, t-SNE, or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, is another commonly used dimensionality reduction algorithm. It works by using a probability distribution over pairs of points to preserve important features within the data while minimizing noise and other irrelevant information. A 2D or 3D representation is then created based on this probability distribution, which can be used for visualization and analysis of the data.

### Wikipedia description


t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a statistical method for visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. It is based on Stochastic Neighbor Embedding originally developed by Geoffrey Hinton and Sam Roweis, where Laurens van der Maaten proposed the t-distributed variant. It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability.
