## Description


Bayesâ€™ theorem is a fundamental statistic theorem that allows us to make predictions about future observations considering the relations between different variables. Naive Bayes is a simple machine learning algorithm based on this theorem that assumes that each variable is independent of the others. This allows it to easily model complex data using only a small amount of training data. Naive Bayes is commonly used for classification tasks as a simple yet effective algorithm.

### Wikipedia description


In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of linear "probabilistic classifiers" which assumes that the features are conditionally independent, given the target class. The strength (naivety) of this assumption is what gives the classifier its name. These classifiers are among the simplest Bayesian network models.
