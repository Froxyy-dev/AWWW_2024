## Description


Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is loosely based on the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of several interconnected nodes, commonly referred to as neurons, which can be configured to process data differently. Weights are assigned to the connections between each node, allowing the network to “learn” from the provided data.

### Wikipedia description


A neural network is a group of interconnected units called neurons that send signals to one another. Neurons can be either biological cells or mathematical models. While individual neurons are simple, many of them together in a network can perform complex tasks. There are two main types of neural network.
