## Description


LDA, or linear discriminant analysis, is similar to Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant analysis used in statistics. It uses data analysis to predict a categorical output based on multiple features. The relationship between features is used to make predictions about the future outcome. Both the features and the output can be continuous or categorical, making this a very versatile algorithm for many different types of machine-learning problems.

### Wikipedia description


Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), normal discriminant analysis (NDA), or discriminant function analysis is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification.
