## Description


Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, or DBSCAN for short, is another type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It works by taking into account the distance between data points and their density to create clusters that contain both close points and those with high densities. The highest-density clusters are determined first, which allows the algorithm to focus on these high-quality clusters before moving on to lower-quality ones.

### Wikipedia description


Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm proposed by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, JÃ¶rg Sander and Xiaowei Xu in 1996.
It is a density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away).
DBSCAN is one of the most common, and most commonly cited, clustering algorithms.
