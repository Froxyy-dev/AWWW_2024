# Linear Regression

## Description


Perhaps the most commonly used machine learning algorithm, linear regression, predicts the relationship between two variables. This simple algorithm is used to make linear predictions based on a set of training data. Linear regression can be used for classification and regression problems, and it is often one of the first algorithms people learn when they start machine learning.

### Wikipedia description


In statistics, linear regression is a statistical model which estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable. If the explanatory variables are measured with error then errors-in-variables models are required, also known as measurement error models.
