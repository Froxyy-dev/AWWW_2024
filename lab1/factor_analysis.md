# Factor Analysis

## Description


Factor analysis observes variability in data. It seeks to identify a relatively small number of unobserved variables that explain the observed variability, called factors. It reduces the need for data collection by focusing on the relationships between existing variables.

### Wikipedia description


Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors plus "error" terms, hence factor analysis can be thought of as a special case of errors-in-variables models.
