## Description


Next, PCA, or principal component analysis, is a pattern-detection algorithm commonly used in conjunction with neural networks. It works by finding a direction within a dataset that maximizes the variance of that data. This allows it to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by pulling out patterns and trends, which can then be used for more detailed analysis.
