## Description


ICA is used to find independent components within a dataset. These “hidden patterns” can then be used to make predictions or extract more information about the data. It assumes that maximum one of the components in a given dataset is Gaussian and the other components are independent of each other.

### Wikipedia description


In signal processing, independent component analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents. ICA has been invented by Jeanny Hérault and Christian Jutten in 1985.This is done by assuming that at most one subcomponent is Gaussian and that the subcomponents are statistically independent from each other. ICA is a special case of blind source separation. A common example application is the "cocktail party problem" of listening in on one person's speech in a noisy room.
