# K-Means Clustering

## Description


To cluster simply means to categorize data points based on similarities. K-means clustering is a common technique for unsupervised machine learning, meaning it is used without any labeled training data. It works by assigning each data point to a cluster using the Euclidean distance between them, intending to minimize variance within groups while maximizing the similarity between clusters.

### Wikipedia description


k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances. For instance, better Euclidean solutions can be found using k-medians and k-medoids.
