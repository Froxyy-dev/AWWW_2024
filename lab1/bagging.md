## Description


Bootstrap aggregating, or bagging for short, is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses resampling techniques to create subsamples of the training data. This means that you can use individual data points multiple times to train a model, improving the algorithmâ€™s overall performance. Once the models have been trained, they are combined in some way to make a final prediction.

### Wikipedia description


Bootstrap aggregating, also called bagging (from bootstrap aggregating), is a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms used in statistical classification and regression. It also reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, it can be used with any type of method. Bagging is a special case of the model averaging approach.
