## Description


Finally, dimensionality reduction is another important technique for working with high-dimensional data. It refers to any method that reduces the number of dimensions in a dataset while preserving the most relevant information. Common methods include principal component analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and clustering algorithms like k-means or spectral clustering. With proper dimensionality reduction, we can gain important insights about our data and make more accurate predictions.

### Wikipedia description


Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension. Working in high-dimensional spaces can be undesirable for many reasons; raw data are often sparse as a consequence of the curse of dimensionality, and analyzing the data is usually computationally intractable (hard to control or deal with). Dimensionality reduction is common in fields that deal with large numbers of observations and/or large numbers of variables, such as signal processing, speech recognition, neuroinformatics, and bioinformatics.
