## Introduction


The new age of computing is heavily reliant on machine learning and the algorithms that power it. These algorithms process and understand large amounts of data, allowing machines to make predictions and decisions without human input.
There are dozens of machine learning algorithms, each with strengths and weaknesses. This post will explore the top 20 most commonly used machine learning algorithms and discuss what makes them unique.
