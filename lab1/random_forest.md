# Random Forest

## Description


A random forest is used to build multiple decision trees based on the same training data. As each tree is generated, random subsets of the data are used to train the tree. This process is repeated for each individual tree in the forest, which means that there will be thousands or even millions of different decision trees within a single model.

### Wikipedia description


Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.: 587–588
