# One-Class SVM

## Description


Much like regular SVMs, one-class SVMs are used for classification problems. However, this algorithm uses a hypersphere instead of using a hyperplane to identify which data points belong to the same class. It can encompass only a single class of data points, allowing it to be used for novelty or outlier detection.

### Wikipedia description


In machine learning, one-class classification (OCC), also known as unary classification or class-modelling, tries to identify objects of a specific class amongst all objects, by primarily learning from a training set containing only the objects of that class, although there exist variants of one-class classifiers where counter-examples are used to further refine the classification boundary. This is different from and more difficult than the traditional classification problem, which tries to distinguish between two or more classes with the training set containing objects from all the classes. Examples include the monitoring of helicopter gearboxes, motor failure prediction, or the operational status of a nuclear plant as 'normal': In this scenario, there are few, if any, examples of catastrophic system states; only the statistics of normal operation are known.
